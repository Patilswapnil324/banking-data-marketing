Term deposits are a major source of income for a bank.

A term deposit is a cash investment held at a financial institution. Your money is invested for an agreed rate of interest over a fixed amount of time, or term.

The bank has various outreach plans to sell term deposits to their customers such as email marketing, advertisements, telephonic marketing, and digital marketing.

Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way to reach out to people.
However, they require huge investment as large call centers are hired to actually execute these campaigns.
Hence, it is crucial to identify the customers most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically targeted via call.


Performed data analysis & model building on the same data as well as measured the performance using diffrent models.

i.e logistic regression.kernel svm,decision trees , random forest & k nearest neighbors.

out of this random forest gives better accuarcy score as compared to others so have tested the model on the same.
